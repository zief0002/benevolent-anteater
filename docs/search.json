For example, in our standard normal distribution outcomes near zero are more probable than outcomes near 1, which are more probable than outcomes near 2, etc. Since we can’t use probability to do this (remember the probability of each outcome is the same, namely 0), we use something called probability density. This is akin to a relative probability, so outcomes with a higher probability density are more likely than outcomes with a lower probability density.\nThe mapping of all the outcomes to their probability densities is called a probability density function (PDF). Thus the equation or “bell-shaped” curve describing the standard normal distribution in Figure 1 is technically a PDF Here are some laws governing PDFs:\n\nProbability densities are always positive.\nThe probability of an outcome x between a and b equals the integral (area under the curve) between a and b of the probability density function. That is:\n\n\\[\np(a \\leq x \\leq b) = \\int_a^b p(x) dx\n\\]\n\nThe area under the curve from negative infinity to positive infinity is 1.

    "section": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density",
    "text": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density\nThe function pnorm() computes the area under the PDF curve from \\(-\\infty\\) to some x-value. (Sometimes this is referred to as the cumulative probability density of x.) It is important to note that the PDF is defined such that the entire area under the curve is equal to 1. Because of this, we can also think about using area under the curve as an analog to probability in a continuous distribution.\nFor example, we might ask about the probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 given it is from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. Symbolically, we want to find:\n\\[\nP\\bigg(x \\leq 65 \\mid \\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\bigg)\n\\]\nThis is akin to finding the proportion of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) PDF that is to the left of 65. The figure below shows a graphical depiction of the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\nCode\n# Create dataset\nfig_03 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = 10, to = 90, by = 0.01)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n    )\n\n# Filter out X&lt;=65\nshaded = fig_03 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &lt;= 65)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_03, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shaded, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"X\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. The area that is shaded grey (relative to the total area under the PDF) represents the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\n\n\nWe can compute the cumulative probability density using the pnorm() function. The “p” stand for “probability”.\n\n# Find P(x&lt;=65 | N(50,10) )\npnorm(q = 65, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 0.9331928\n\n\nWe can interpret this as:\n\nThe probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 (if it is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10) is 0.933.\n\nIn mathematics, the area under a curve is called an integral. The grey-shaded area in the previous figure can also be expressed as an integral of the probability density function:\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{65} p(x) dx\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(x)\\) is the PDF for the normal distribution.\nThe most common application for finding the cumulative density is to compute a p-value. The p-value is just the area under the distribution (curve) that is AT LEAST as extreme as some observed value. For example, assume we computed a test statistic of \\(z=2.5\\), and were evaluating whether this was different from 0 (two-tailed test). Graphically, we want to determine the proportion of the area under the PDF that is shaded grey in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\n# Create data\nfig_04 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.01)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n    )\n\n# Filter data for shading\nshade_01 = fig_04 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &gt;= 2.5)\n\nshade_02 = fig_04 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &lt;= -2.5)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_04, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_01, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_02, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"z\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for the standard normal distribution (\\(M=0\\), \\(SD=1\\)). The cumulative density representing the p-value for a two-tailed test evaluating whether \\(\\mu=0\\) using an observed mean of 2.5 is also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nIf the distribution of the test statistic is normally distributed, we can use pnorm() to compute the p-value. If we assume the test statistic, z, has been scaled to use standardized units, the standard deviation we use in pnorm() will be sd=1. The mean is based on the value being tested in the null hypothesis. In most null hypotheses, we are testing a difference from 0 (e.g., \\(H_0: \\mu=0\\), \\(H_0: \\beta=0\\)), so we would use mean=0 in the pnorm() function.\nRemember, pnorm() computes the proportion of the area under the curve TO THE LEFT of a particular value. Here we will compute the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) and then double it to produce the actual p-value. (We can double it because the normal distribution is symmetric so the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) is the same as the area to the right of \\(+2.5\\).)\n\n# Compute the p-value based on z=2.5\n2 * pnorm(q = -2.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.01241933\n\n\nWe interpret this p-value as:\n\nThe probability of observing a statistic at least as extreme as 2.5, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is 0.012. This is evidence against the null hypothesis since the data are inconsistent with the assumed hypothesis.\n\n\n\nqnorm(): Computing Quantiles\nThe qnorm() function is essentially the inverse of the pnorm() function. The pnorm() function computes the cumulative probability GIVEN a particular quantile (x-value). The qnorm() function computes the quantile GIVEN a cumulative probability. For example, in the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) distribution, half of the area under the PDF is below the x-value (quantile) of 50.\nTo use the qnorm() function to give the x-value (quantile) that defines the lower 0.5 of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) PDF, the syntax would be:\n\n# Find the quantile that has a cumulative density of 0.5 in the N(50, 10) distribution\nqnorm(p = 0.5, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\n\n\nrnorm(): Generating Random Observations\nThe rnorm() function can be used to generate random observations drawn from a specified normal distribution. Aside from the mean= and sd= arguments, we also need to specify the number of observations to generate by including the argument n=. For example, to generate 15 observations drawn from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution we would use the following syntax:\n\n# Generate 15 observations from N(50,10)\nset.seed(100)\nrnorm(n = 15, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n [1] 44.97808 51.31531 49.21083 58.86785 51.16971 53.18630 44.18209 57.14533\n [9] 41.74741 46.40138 50.89886 50.96274 47.98366 57.39840 51.23380\n\n\nThe set.seed() function sets the state of the random number generator used in R so that the results are reproducible. If you don’t use set.seed() you will get a different set of observations each time you run rnorm(). Here we set the starting seed to 100, but you can set this to any integer you want."

    "section": "Mean Squares are Variance Estimates",
    "text": "Mean Squares are Variance Estimates\nMean squares are also estimates of the variance. Consider the computational formula for the sample variance,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum(Y - \\bar{Y})^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nThis is the total sum of squares divided by the total df. The variance of the outcome variable is interpreted as the average amount of variation in the outcome variable (in the squared metric). Thus, it is also referred to as the mean square total.\nWhen we compute an F-statistic, we are finding the ratio of two different variance estimates—one based on the model (explained variance) and one based on the error (unexplained variance). Under the null hypothesis that \\(\\rho^2 = 0\\), we are assuming that all the variance is unexplained. In that case, our F-statistic would be close to zero. When the model explains a significant amount of variation, the numerator gets larger relative to the denominator and the F-value is larger.\nThe mean squared error (from the anova() output) plays a special role in regression analysis. It is the variance estimate for the conditional distributions of the residuals in our visual depiction of the distributional assumptions of the residuals underlying linear regression.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Visual Depiction of the Distributional Assumptions of the Residuals Underlying Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\nRecall that we made implicit assumptions about the conditional distributions of the residuals, namely that they were identically and normally distributed with a mean of zero and some variance. Based on the estimate of the mean squared error, the variance of each of these distributions is 58.5.\nWhile the variance is a mathematical convenience, the standard deviation is often a better descriptor of the variation in a distribution since it is measured in the original metric. The standard deviation fro the residuals (error) is 7.6. Because the residuals are statistics (summaries computed from sample data), their standard deviation is referred to as a “standard error”.\n\nThe residual standard error (RSE) is sometimes referred to as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\n\n# Compute RMSE\nsqrt(58.5)\n\n[1] 7.648529\n\n\nWhy is this value important? It gives the expected variation in the conditional residual distributions, which is a measure of the average amount of error. For example, since all of the conditional distributions of the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed, we would expect that 95% of the residuals would fall between \\(\\pm2\\) standard errors from 0; or, in this case, between \\(-15.3\\) and \\(+15.3\\). Observations with residuals that are more extreme may be regression outliers.\nMore importantly, it is a value that we need to estimate in order to specify the model."

A label is the name of this code chunk. (Any code chunk, even if it is not a plot, can have a label.) In the plot below, the chunk’s label is fig-scatterplot.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between political corruption and environmental program strength.\"\nggplot(data = woods, aes(x = envprogstr, y = corrupt)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot showing the relationship between political corruption and environmental program strength.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that by labeling this chunk, the figure is numbered in the document. We also added a caption using the fig-cap: option.\n\n\nFigure Size\nThere are a couple other chunk options for figures that help set the aspect ratio and size of the figure in your document. The aspect ratio is the ratio of a figure’s width to its height. We set this using the fig-width: and fig-height: chunk options. (The default value for both is 6; thus the figure appears square.)

Many times you need to find a good aspect ratio though trial-and-error of trying different values.\n\nThe actual size of the figure in the document is independent of the aspect ratio and can be set using the out-width: or out-height: chunk option. These options take a character string of the direct size (in HTML documents this is typically in pixels) or of the percentage of the output width/height. Here we keep the same aspect ratio, but make the figure smaller by setting the figure width to 40% of the document’s width.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot-3\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between political corruption and environmental program strength.\"\n#| fig-width: 9\n#| fig-height: 5\n#| out-width: \"40%\"\nggplot(data = woods, aes(x = envprogstr, y = corrupt)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatterplot showing the relationship between political corruption and environmental program strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set the aspect ratio of the figure, you need only set out-width: or out-height:. You don’t need to set both as the other will be determined by the aspect ratio."

That being said, as you develop naming conventions for your projects, all the conventions should be documented! This documentation helps onboard collaborators to your project.\n\nThere are several guides available to help you establish naming conventions including here and here."

However, they do typically include Markdown syntax (which is itself plain text). The plain text nature of these files keeps them small in size and accessible to anyone with any type of computer.\n\nThere are several online guides for what to include in a README file, including here and here. There is also a pretty good template for a README for data science oriented projects here.\n\nSince the README file is informational, you can include any type of information in this file that is useful to the project. For example, you could add your naming conventions to this file.\n# assignment-01\n\nThis directory contains all of the files necessary to complete Assignment 1.\n\n\n# Naming Conventions\n\n- File names should be short but descriptive (less than 25 characters)\n- All lowercase letters\n- Avoid special characters and spaces in a file name\n  + Use hyphens instead of spaces to separate words (e.g., `assignment-01`)\n- Any names that include the date will use the ISO 8601 date format (YYYYMMDD)\n- Any names that include a number will include at least two digits (e.g., `assignment-01` rather than `assignment-1`)\n\nWhile you should only have one README file per directory, you can have different README files in other directories. For example, you could create a README file in the data directory that includes the codebook information for your data files."

The course content for EPsy 8252 builds on the content of EPsy 8251 and includes: (1) non-linear transformations, (2) likelihood estimation and inference, (2) information criteria for model selection, (3) logistic models for analyzing dichotomous outcomes, and (4) mixed-effects models for analysis of longitudinal data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPsy 8252 is a 3 credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see Expected Time per Course Credit Policy). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10–15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that—it all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course."

    "text": "Statistical Computing\nStatistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 8251. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS https://www.r-project.org. It should be noted that while some R syntax and programming is taught during class time, there is also a fair amount that you may need to learn on your own outside of class. There are several tutorials and resources linked from the course website to help you learn R.\nYou can install R and RStudio onto your local machine. (There are instructions for how to do this on the course website.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.\n\n\nA Note on Inclusion and Respect\nIn this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another’s individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class."

Because the data for this predictor come from a Likert scale (ordinal in nature), we need to examine whether we can treat it as a continuous predictor in the model, or whether we should treat it as categorical.\n\nBegin by computing the empirical proportion of people that support same-sex marriage for each of the attendance categories. Create a line plot that shows the relationship between proportion of support and attendance.\n\nBased on the plot you just created, the relationship between proportion of support and attendance seems linear. Because of this, we can treat the Likert data as continuous; using a line (or polynomial) to fit the relationship. The only caution being that when interpreting a slope, we say something like, “a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)-unit difference in \\(Y\\)”. For ordinal (Likert) data a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) really indicates a shift from one category to the next highest category.\n\nFit two logistic models to the data using religious service attendance. In the first model, only include the linear effect of attendance. In the second model, include both a linear and quadratic effect to predict variation in support for same-sex marriage. Which model should be adopted (linear or quadratic)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision.

Before you submit the assignment check that:\n\nAll group members’ names are on the assignment.\nAll tables are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.\nNo R syntax is included unless the question specifically asked for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata).\nDo not submit the script file you used unless the directions specifically ask you to submit it.\n\nDo I need to turn in the script file?\nNo…unless the directions specifically ask you to submit the script file. The script file is for your reference. Future assignments will sometimes have questions that reference older assignments, so an organized and well-commented script file is a good idea. Moreover, the TA or myself may ask you to submit your syntax after you submit the assignment to help us interpret mistakes you made on the assignment so that we can provide more thorough feedback.\nWill you provide answer keys to the assignments?\nNo. You will get back several comments on your assignments that address what you did wrong. The educational research is pretty clear that feedback is more helpful to student learning than providing correct answers. If you have further questions or need additional clarification, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you go over the answers in class?\nNo. I will address broad concepts if several students/groups made the same mistake, but otherwise, since each student/group makes unique mistakes going over the assignments more broadly is not a good use of our limited class time. The feedback should be helpful in understanding any mistakes you made, but if it isn’t, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you look at our assignment prior to us submitting it?\nThe instructor or TA will not “pre-grade” your assignment. If there is a “Preparation” part of the assignment we can ensure that you did that part correctly, and we can also give you feedback about syntax, but we will not tell you if an answer is correct or not. We can also answer clarifying questions (e.g., ‘I know Question 8 is asking about […], but I’m not sure what this question is looking for. Is there another way to restate this question?’). If you completed the assignment without any trouble, then be confident in your work and simply submit the assignment! 😄 If you are unsure about something specific, then ask about that specific thing rather than a general ‘did I do this right’!\nWill we be able to re-do the assignment?\nGenerally no. Since you have the opportunity to work in groups on the assignments, you should be able offset any of the issues that come up that would necessitate a re-submission. The exception to this is that we may allow you to re-do Assignment 1. If we do this, we will send you an email requesting that you resubmit part, or all of Assignment 1. You will not receive much feedback on your assignment prior to your re-submission. This is because during the first assignment you are learning not only content, but also expectations around how to respond to the questions we ask."

    "text": "Policy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work\nStudents are responsible for planning their schedules to avoid excessive conflicts with course requirements and must notify the instructor of unavoidable scheduling conflicts as early as possible. For circumstances where absences are unavoidable, accommodations for makeup work will be made according to University Policy. If you miss class:\n\nEmail the instructor as soon as you know you will be missing class.\nStudents are expected to obtain notes from a classmate of class material missed.\nPlease note that I will not be recording class sessions at the request of individual students, nor will I be Zooming students in to the class. Although, if you can arrange it with a classmate, they can Zoom you in.\n\nIf you are zooming in a classmate, please let the instructor know.\n\nIf you will be gone the day an assignment is due, you will need to make arrangements with the instructor about when you will turn in the assignment.\n\nIf you do not communicate with the instructor and make arrangements for turning in work when you are absent, the assignment will receive a 0.\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other AI Policy\nArtificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, are emerging tools that we will all need to consider in the next few years. These tools may be used to help you write R syntax, but not for answering any of the other questions on the assignment. If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me or the TA. If you do use any AI to help write syntax for any of the assignment questions you need to do the following:\n\nCite this in the assignment; failure to do so is in violation of the academic integrity policy at UMN. Please include a paragraph at the end of any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results. More examples of citing AI language models are available at: https://libguides.umn.edu/chatgpt.\nInclude a statement about what you will do to offset the environmental impact of the energy use incurred by using the AI. Be specific in this statement. For example: I will bike to school for the next week (Jan. 01–Jan 07) rather than drive or bus.\n\nYou are also responsible for ensuring any syntax composed by AI is correct. I would not trust anything AI says. If it gives you a number, fact, or code, assume it is wrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another source. For this reason, using AI works best for topics you understand and can quality check. Here are a couple of other things to be aware of if you decide to use AI:\n\nThe environmental impact of AI should not be ignored. The building and usage of AI tools consumes a lot of energy (see here and here).\nThe development of AI has been associated with labor abuse and other dicey ethical issues (see here and here).\n\nIf you are caught using AI to answer questions on any of the assignments, you will be given a 0 on that assignment and a Scholastic Dishonesty Report Form will be filled out and reported to the Office of Community Standards. Depending on the severity of the offense, the instructor also reserves the right to give you an “F” in the course.\n\n\n\nTechnology Policy\nThe course uses technology on a regular basis during both instruction and assessments (e.g., homework assignments, exams, etc.). Student difficulty with obtaining or operating the various software programs and technologies—including printer trouble—will not be acceptable as an excuse for late work. Due to the variation in computer types and systems, the instructor or TA may not be able to assist in trouble shooting all problems you may have.\n\n\n\n\nCEHD Policy on Recording Classes\nAll class sessions may be recorded by the instructor using the procedures in the CEHD Policy on Recording Classes, with or without prior notice. Students should assume that a class session is being recorded unless otherwise notified. No person (student or otherwise) may record a class without express written permission from the instructor or an authorized administrator implementing a disability accommodation. All permitted recordings are governed by this policy’s limits on distribution and redistribution of recordings."

    "text": "Any table is essentially a rectangular layout (rows and columns) of information. Below I show two common tables of statistical output taken from the Regression Review notes. I have also added guide-lines to show the rectangular display of information within each of these tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate how to create a table in the QMD document, we will attempt to recreate Table 1 from the Regression Review notes. We can use the fact that data frames are also rectangular displays of information to create a table in the QMD document. The data.frame() function is used to enter the cell information from each column. This is, of course, done in a code chunk.\n\n# Input cell information\ntab_01 = data.frame(\n  variable = c(\"Environmental policy strength\", \"Corruption\", \"Wealth\", \"Toxic waste severity\", \n               \"Democratic control\", \"Interparty competition\", \"Public environmentalism\"),\n  m = c(17.6, .32, 28.15, 3.53, .63, 39.03, 2.49),\n  sd = c(8.23, .22, 36.38, 1.14, .26, 11.40, .10),\n  min = c(4, 0, 12.78, 0, 0, 9.26, 2.31),\n  max = c(37, .98, 278.01, 5.76, 1, 56.58, 2.7)\n)\n\n# Show output\ntab_01\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nHere we entered the cell data in manually, however, most of the time these values will be generated from functions that produce data frames. For example, the output from tidy(), glance(), correlate(), and {dplyr} functionality is a data frame. This output can be used directly when we create our table."

    "text": "Adding a Title and Subtitle (Using Quarto)\nIf you are creating a table within a QMD document, we will use the code chunk options to add a table number, title, and subtitle. To create these use the following code chunks:\n\nThe label: field is used to label the table and give it a table number. The key here is that the lable name must start withtbl-. In the example below, the label name I gave the table is tbl-summary-measures.\nThe tbl-cap: field is used to provide a table caption, similar to how fig-cap: is used to give a figure caption.\nThe tbl-subcap: field is used to provide a table subcaption. Not all tables need a subcaption!\nThe tbl-cap-location: field can be use to change the table caption location from top to bottom, or even have it placed in the margin.\n\nHere we show the R code chunk and chunk options to produce the table numbering and caption. (I do not use a subcaption on this table.) The resulting table, along with its numbering (which is autopopulated by Quarto), and caption is shown below.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-summary-measures\n#| tbl-cap: \"Summary statistics for the unstandardized outcome, focal predictor, and five covariates.\"\ntab_01 |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    variable = md(\"*Variable*\"),\n    m = md(\"*M*\"),\n    sd = md(\"*SD*\"),\n    min = md(\"*Min.*\"),\n    max = md(\"*Max.*\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(variable),\n    align = \"left\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(m, sd, min, max),\n    align = \"center\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_align_table_header(\"left\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.  Summary statistics for the unstandardized outcome, focal predictor,\nand five covariates. \n  \n    \n    \n      Variable\n      M\n      SD\n      Min.\n      Max.\n    \n  \n  \n    Environmental policy strength\n17.60\n8.23\n4.00\n37.00\n    Corruption\n0.32\n0.22\n0.00\n0.98\n    Wealth\n28.15\n36.38\n12.78\n278.01\n    Toxic waste severity\n3.53\n1.14\n0.00\n5.76\n    Democratic control\n0.63\n0.26\n0.00\n1.00\n    Interparty competition\n39.03\n11.40\n9.26\n56.58\n    Public environmentalism\n2.49\n0.10\n2.31\n2.70\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage to including a label: and naming it with a tbl- prefix is that it makes your tables cross-referenceable in the document. In the document’s text you can link to that table using the @ and giving the table name. For example, see Table 1. To do this I wrote the following in my Quarto document:\nFor example, see @tbl-summary-measures.\nSee here for more detail about cross-referencing tables, substables, figures, equations, and more!\n\nChanging the Formatting of the Table Numbering\nWe can change how Quarto formats the table labeling in the YAML part of the document. The default is: “Table X: Table Caption”. Here we make “Table X.” bold with a period after it, where “X” is an arabic number.\ncrossref:\n  tbl-title: \"**Table**\"\n  tbl-labels: arabic\n  title-delim: \".\""

For example, we could remove the horizontal lines in the table. These lines are called “borders” and we can modify them in the tab_style() function. This is a general function that allows us to customize many parts of the table (akin to theme() in ggplot()).\nTo do this we use the style= argument and call the cell_borders() function within tab_style(). Here we remove all borders (top, bottom, left, and right) by using sides=\"all\" and setting style=NULL. The tab_style() function also requires the argument locations=. We give this argument the function cell_body() which we provide the column and row numbers that we want to remove the borders from. Since we want to keep the horizontal border associated with the first and last rows, we omit those row numbers from the rows= argument.\n\n# Add title and subtitle\ntab_01 |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    variable = md(\"*Variable*\"),\n    m = md(\"*M*\"),\n    sd = md(\"*SD*\"),\n    min = md(\"*Min.*\"),\n    max = md(\"*Max.*\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(variable),\n    align = \"left\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(m, sd, min, max),\n    align = \"center\"\n  ) |&gt;\n    tab_header(\n    title = md(\"**Table 1.** Summary statistics for the unstandardized outcome, focal predictor, and five covariates.\"),\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_align_table_header(\"left\")  |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_borders(\n      sides = \"all\", \n      style = NULL\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = 1:5,\n      rows = 2:6\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Table 1.

    "section": "Log-Likelihood",
    "text": "Log-Likelihood\nThe likelihood values are quite small since we are multiplying several probability densities (values between 0 and 1) together. Since it is hard to work with these smaller values, in practice, we often compute and work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood. So in our example, Model 0 (\\(\\mathcal{L}_0 = 5.452323 \\times 10^{-26}\\)) has a log-likelihood of:\n\n# Log-likelihood for Model 0\nlog(5.452323e-26)\n\n[1] -58.17117\n\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the log-likelihood for Model 1 as:\n\n# Log-likelihood for Model 1\nlog(1.680643e-20)\n\n[1] -45.53253\n\n\nWe typically denote log-likelihood using a scripted lower-case “l” (\\(\\mathcal{l}\\)). Here,\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathcal{l}_0 &= -58.17117 \\\\[1ex]\n\\mathcal{l}_1 &= -45.53253 \\\\[1ex]\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nNote that the logarithm of a decimal will be negative, so the log-likelihood will be a negative value. Less negative log-likelihood values correspond to higher likelihood values, which indicate more empirical support. Here Model 1 has a log-likelihood value (\\(-58.2\\)) that is less negative than Model 0’s log-likelihood value (\\(-45.5\\)), which indicates there is more empirical support for Model 1 than Model 0.\nWe can also express the likelihood ratio using log-likelihoods. To do so we take the natural logarithm of the likelihood ratio. We also re-write it using the rules of logarithms from algebra.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\ln(\\mathrm{LR}) &= \\ln \\bigg(\\frac{\\mathcal{L}_2}{\\mathcal{L}_1}\\bigg) \\\\[2ex]\n&= \\ln \\big(\\mathcal{L}_2\\big) - \\ln \\big(\\mathcal{L}_1\\big)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThat is, we can find an equivalent relative support metric to the LR based on the log-likelihoods by computing the difference between them. For our example:\n\n# Difference in log-likelihoods\nlog(1.680643e-20) - log(5.452323e-26)\n\n[1] 12.63865\n\n# Equivalent to ln(LR)\nlog(1.680643e-20 / 5.452323e-26)\n\n[1] 12.63865\n\n\nUnfortunately, this difference doesn’t have the same interpretational value as the LR does, bcause this difference is in log-units. In order to get that interpretation back, we need to exponentiate (the reverse function of the logarithm) the difference:\n\n# Exponentiate the difference in log-likelihoods\nexp(12.63865)\n\n[1] 308244.9\n\n\nAgain, Model 1 has 308244.9 times the empirical support than Model 0.\n\nMathematics of Log-Likelihood\nWe can express the log-likelihood of the regression residuals mathematically by taking the natural logarithm of the likelihood we computed earlier:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\ln \\Bigl(\\mathcal{L}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data})\\Bigr) &= \\ln \\Biggl( \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{\\epsilon}\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\right]^n \\times \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_1^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\times  \\\\\n&~~~~~~ \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_2^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\times \\ldots \\times \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\epsilon_n^2}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}}\\right] \\Biggr) \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nUsing our rules for logarithms and re-arranging gives,\n\\[\n\\mathcal{l}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data}) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\ln (2\\pi\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}} \\times \\sum \\epsilon_i^2\n\\]\nExamining this equation, we see that the log-likelihood is a function of \\(n\\), \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\) and the sum of squared residuals (SSR)1. We can of course, re-express this using the the regression parameters:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{l}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data}) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\ln (2\\pi\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}} \\times \\sum \\big[Y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1(X_i)\\big]^2\n\\]\nAnd, again, since \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\) is a function of the regression coefficients and \\(n\\), this means that the only variables in the log-likelihood function are the coefficients."

    "section": "Shortcut: The logLik() Function",
    "text": "Shortcut: The logLik() Function\nThe logLik() function can be used to obtain the log-likelihood directly from a fitted model object. For example, to find the log-likelihood for Model 1, we can use:\n\n# Compute log-likelihood for Model 1\nlogLik(lm.1)\n\n'log Lik.' -45.44917 (df=6)\n\n\nThe df output tells us how many total parameters are being estimated in the model. In our case this is six (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{Enrollment}}\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{FT~Students}}\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{FT~Faculty}}\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{Tuition}}\\), and \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)). What is more important to us currently, is the log-likelihood value; \\(\\mathcal{l}_1=-45.44917\\).\nThis value is slightly different than the log-likelihood we just computed of \\(-45.53253\\). This is not because of rounding in this case. It has to do with how the model is being estimated; the logLik() function assumes the parameters are being estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS). You can learn more about ML estimation in the optional set of notes, but for now, we will just use logLik() to compute the log-likelihood.\nHere we compute the log-likelihood for Model 0 using the logLik() function. We also use the output to compute the likelihood, and the likelihood ratio between Model 1 and Model 0\n\n# Compute log-likelihood for Model 0\nlogLik(lm.0)\n\n'log Lik.' -58.16733 (df=2)\n\n# Compute likelihood for Model 2\nexp(logLik(lm.0)[1])\n\n[1] 5.473293e-26\n\n# Compute difference in log-likelihoods\nlogLik(lm.1)[1] - logLik(lm.0)[1]\n\n[1] 12.71816\n\n# Compute LR\nexp( logLik(lm.1)[1] - logLik(lm.0)[1] )\n\n[1] 333754.4\n\n\nBecause the output from logLik() includes extraneous information (e.g., df), we use indexing (square brackets) to extract only the part of the output we want. In this case, the [1] extracts the log-likelihood value from the logLik() output (ignoring the df part).\nAlso of note is that the df for Model 0 is two, indicating that this model is estimating two parameters (\\(\\beta_0\\), and \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)). The value of df in the logLik() output is a quantification of the model’s complexity. Here Model 1 2 (df = 6) is more complex than Model 0 (df = 2).\nAs we consider using the likelihood ratio (LR) or the difference in log-likelihoods for model selection, we also need to consider the model complexity. In our example, the likelihood ratio of 333754.4 (computed using logLik()) indicates that Model 1 has approximately 333,754 times the empirical support than Model 0. But, Model 1 is more complex than Model 0, so we would expect that it would be more empirically supported.\nIn this case, with a LR of 333,754, it seems like the data certainly support adopting Model 1 over Model 0, despite the added complexity of Model 1. But what if the LR was 10? Would that be enough additional support to warrant adopting Model 1 over Model 0? What about a LR of 5?"

Note that we are making a holistic evaluation about the model rather than about individual predictors. Based on the LR test we conducted we cannot say which predictors are statistically relevant, only that the set of predictors included in Model 1 is more supported than no predictors.\nTo determine how much more variation Model 1 explains in peer ratingfs than Model 0 does, we look at the \\(R^2\\) values from the glance() output.\n\n# Model-level output Model 0\nglance(lm.0)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Model-level output Model 1\nglance(lm.1)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nModel 1 explains 26.4% of the variation in peer ratings compared to Model 0, which explains 0% of the variation in peer ratings.

For low fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be less than zero, for moderate fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be more than zero, and for high fitted values it appears as though the average residual may be less than zero.\nNotice that the pattern displayed in the residuals is consistent with the pattern of the observed data in the initial scatterplot (Figure 1). If we look at the data relative to the regression smoother we see that there is not even vertical scatter around this line. At low and high SAT scores the observed data tends to be below the regression line (the regression is over-estimating the average graduation rate), while for moderate SAT scores the observed data tends to be above the regression line (the regression is under-estimating the average graduation rate)."

This is the evidence that we would use to justify retaining the quadratic effect in the model. This plot also suggests that the homoskedasticity assumption is tenable. Finally, the empirical density of the residuals also seems consistent with the assumption of normality for this model.\nReminder: The assumption of independence can’t be evaluated from the plots, but is vary important given we rely on it to be able to correctly compute the likelihood. From the design of the study, we haven’t sampled the schools randomly, nor randomly assigned the schools to their levels of the predictor(s), so we can’t infer independence from that. So the question becomes, does knowing the graduation rate of a school in the population give us information about the graduation rate for other schools in the population with the same median SAT score? If the answer is “no”, then we can call the independence assumption tenable. If the answer is “yes”, the independence assumption is violated and we should not use the lm() function or believe that results from that function are valid."

    "section": "Algebraic Interpretation",
    "text": "Algebraic Interpretation\nFrom algebra, you may remember that the coefficient in front of the quadratic term (\\(-2.2\\)) informs us of whether the quadratic is an upward-facing U-shape, or a downward-facing U-shape. Since our term is negative, the U-shape is downward-facing. This is consistent with what we saw in the plot. What the algebra fails to show is that, within the range of SAT scores in our data, we only see part of the entire downward U-shape.\nThis coefficient also indicates whether the U-shape is skinny or wide. Although “skinny” and “wide” are only useful as relative comparisons. Algebraically, the comparison is typically to a quadratic coefficient of 1, which is generally not useful in our interpretation. The intercept and coefficient for the linear term help us locate the U-shape in the coordinate plane (moving it right, left, up, or down from the origin). You could work all of this out algebraically.\n\nYou can see how different values of these coefficients affect the curve on Wikipedia. Here is an interactive graph that lets you explore how changing the different coefficients changes the parabola.\n\nWhat can be useful is to find where the minimum (upward facing U-shape) or maximum (downward facing U-shape) occurs. This point is referred to as the vertex of the parabola and can be algebraically determined. To do this we determine the x-location of the vertex by\n\\[\nx_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_1}{2 \\times \\hat\\beta_2}\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) is the estimated coefficient for the linear term and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_2\\) is the estimated coefficient for the quadratic term. The y coordinate for the vertex can then be found by substituting the x-coordinate into the fitted equation. For our example,\n\\[\nx_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -\\frac{62.72}{2 \\times -2.15} = 14.58\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ny_\\mathrm{Vertex} = -366.34 + 62.72(14.58) - 2.15(14.58^2) = 91.08\n\\]\nThis suggests that at a median SAT score of 1458 we predict a six-year graduate rate of 91.08. This x-value also represents the value at which the direction of the effect changes. In our example recall that for higher values of SAT the effect of SAT on graduation rate was diminishing. This is true for schools with median SAT scores up to 1458. For schools with higher SAT scores the effect of SAT score on graduation rate would theoretically be negative, and would be more negative for higher values.\nThis is all theoretical as our data only includes median SAT scores up to 1400. Everything past that value (including the vertex) is extrapolation. Extrapolation is exceedingly sketchy when we start fitting non-linear models. For example, do we really think that the average graduation rate for schools with a median SAT scores higher than 1458 would actually be smaller than for schools at 1458? It is more likely that the effect just flattens out."

The quadratic effect of SAT is the same for both public and private institutions. (If we had adopted the model with both interaction terms, the quadratic effect would also be different across sectors.)\nTo visualize the effect of SAT, we can again plot each fitted curve by including each in a separate geom_function() layer.\n\n# Plot of the fitted model\nggplot(data = mn, aes(x = sat, y = grad)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0) +\n    geom_function(\n      fun = function(x) {-378.73 + 67.54 * x - 2.54 * x^2},\n      color = \"#2ec4b6\",\n      linetype = \"dashed\"\n      ) +\n  geom_function(\n    fun = function(x) {-413.80 + 71.65 * x - 2.54 * x^2},\n    color = \"#ff9f1c\",\n    linetype = \"solid\"\n    ) +\n    theme_light() +\n  xlab(\"Estimated median SAT score (in hundreds)\") +\n  ylab(\"Six-year graduation rate\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Six-year graduation rate as a function of median SAT score for private (orange, solid line) and public (blue, dashed line) institutions.\n\n\n\n\nThe curvature (linear and quadratic slopes) of the lines now looks different for the two sectors because of the interaction term. (Note that interactions with the linear effect of SAT or the quadratic effect of SAT contribute to a change in the curvature.) For both sectors, the effect of median SAT on graduation rates is positive (institutions with higher median SAT scores tend to have higher graduation rates. But, this effect diminishes for institutions with increasingly higher SAT scores. Private schools have higher graduation rates, on average, than public schools for all levels of median SAT score. Moreover, this difference in graduation rates is getting larger at higher levels of SAT (that is the interaction!)."

Essentially you would need to search an infinite number of values unless you could limit the search space in some way.

For more complex methods (e.g., mixed-effect models) there is not a mathematical solution. Instead, mathematics is used to help limit the search space and then a grid search is used to hone in on the estimates.\nAlthough not a complication, we made an assumption about the value of the residual standard error, that it was equivalent to sigma(errors).

    "text": "Estimating the Residual Variation: Maximum Likelihood vs. Ordinary Least Squares\nThe estimates of the residual standard error differ because the two estimation methods use different criteria to optimize over; OLS estimation finds the estimates that minimize the sum of squared errors, and ML finds the estimates that maximize the likelihood. Because of the differences, it is important to report how the model was estimated in any publication.\nBoth estimation methods have been well studied, and the resulting residual standard error from these estimation methods can be computed directly once we have the coefficient estimates (which are the same for both methods). Namely, the residual standard error resulting from OLS estimation is:\n\\[\n\\hat\\sigma_{\\epsilon}= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i\\right)^2}{n-p-1}}\n\\]\nwhere p is the number of predictors in the model. And the residual standard error resulting from ML estimation is:\n\\[\n\\hat\\sigma_{\\epsilon}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i\\right)^2}{n}},\n\\]\nThe smaller denominator from the OLS estimate produces a higher overall estimate of the residual variation (more uncertainty). When n is large, the differences between the OLS and ML estimates of the residual standard error are minimal and can safely be ignored. When n is small, however, these differences can impact statistical results. For example, since the residual standard error is used to compute the standard error estimates for the coefficients, the choice of ML or OLS will have an effect on the size of the t- and p-values for the coefficients. (In practice, it is rare to see the different estimation methods producing substantively different findings, especially when fitting general linear models.)\nLastly, we note that the value of log-likelihood is the same for both the ML and OLS estimated models. The result from the ML output was:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n-2 \\ln(\\mathrm{Likelihood}) &= 78.91 \\\\[1ex]\n\\ln(\\mathrm{Likelihood}) &= -39.45\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe log-likelihood for the OLS estimated model is:\n\n# Log-likelihood for OLS model\nlogLik(lm(y ~ 1 + x))\n\n'log Lik.' -39.45442 (df=3)\n\n\nThis is a very useful result. It allows us to use lm() to estimate the coefficients from a model and then use its log-likelihood value in the same way as if we had fitted the model using ML. This will be helpful when we compute measure such as information criteria later in the course.\n\nIn many applications of estimation, it is useful to use a criterion which is modified variant of the likelihood. This variant omits “nuisance parameters” (parameters which are not of direct interest and subsequently not needed in the estimation method) from the computation of the likelihood. This restricted version of the likelihood is then maximized and the estimation method using this modified likelihood is called Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML).\nWhen REML is used to estimate parameters, the residual standard error turns out to be the same as that computed in the OLS estimation. As such, sometimes this estimate is referred to as the REML estimate of the residual standard error."

The two countries which had extremely high CO2 emissions when we examined raw CO2, no longer seems like outliers in the transformed data. The differences in variation of log-carbon emissions between lower wealth and higher wealth countries also seems less severe.\nHas this helped us better meet the distributional assumptions for the regression model? To find out, we will fit the model using the log-transformed carbon emissions and examine the residual plots.\n\n# Fit model\nlm.log2 = lm(l2co2 ~ 1 + wealth, data = carbon)\n\n# Obtain residual plots\nresidual_plots(lm.log2)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Density plot of the standardized residuals (LEFT) and scatterplot of the standarized residuals versus the fitted values (RIGHT) from regressing log-transformed CO2 emisssions on wealth. The reference line of Y=0 is also displayed along with the 95% confidence envelope (grey shaded area). The loess smoother (solid, blue line) shows the empirical relationship betwen the residuals and fitted values.\n\n\n\n\nThese plots suggest that after the transforming the outcome, there is a great deal of improvement in meeting the assumption of normality. The assumption of homoskedasticity also looks markedly improved. There still seems to be violations of the linearity assumption.\n\nFor now, we will proceed so you understand how to interpret coefficients from models where the outcome has been log-transformed, but we will come back and fix this nonlinearity later."

    "text": "Better Interpretations: Back-transforming to the Raw Metric\nWhile these interpretations are technically correct, it is more helpful to your readers (and more conventional) to interpret any regression results in the raw metric of the variable rather than log-transformed metric. This means we have to back-transform the interpretations. To think about how to do this, we first consider a more general expression of the fitted linear model:\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\hat{Y}_i\\right) = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(X_{i})\n\\]\nThe left-hand side of the equation is in the log-transformed metric, which drives our interpretations. If we want to instead, interpret using the raw metric of Y, we need to back-transform from \\(\\log_2(Y)\\) to Y. To back-transform, we use the inverse function, which is to exponentiate using the base of the logarithm, in our case, base-2.\n\\[\n2^{\\log_2(Y_i)} = Y_i\n\\]\nIf we exponentiate the left-hand side of the equation, to maintain the equality, we also need to exponentiate the right-hand side of the equation.\n\\[\n2^{\\log_2(Y_i)} = 2^{\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1(X_{i})}\n\\]\nThen we use rules of exponents to simplify this.\n\\[\nY_i = 2^{\\hat\\beta_0} \\times 2^{\\hat\\beta_1(X_{i})}\n\\]\nFor our example, we exponentiate both sides of the fitted equation to get the following back-transformed fitted equation:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i} = 2^{-3.17} \\times 2^{1.19(\\mathrm{Wealth}_i)}\n\\]\n\n\nSubstituting in Values for Wealth to Interpret Effects\nTo interpret the back-transformed effects, we can substitute in the different values for wealth and solve. For example when wealth = 0:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i} &= 2^{-3.17} \\times 2^{1.19(0)}\\\\\n&= 0.111 \\times 1 \\\\\n&= 0.111\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nIn R, we use the ^ operator to exponentiate. In our example, to compute the predicted caron dioxide emissions, we use the following:\n\n# Compute predicted CO2 when wealth=0\n2^(-3.17) * 2^(1.19 * 0)\n\n[1] 0.1111053\n\n\nThe predicted CO2 emissions for a countries that have a wealth level of 0 is 0.111 metric tons per person, on average (extrapolation). This is how we interpret the intercept! How about countries that have a wealth level of 1 (a one-unit difference in wealth from countries that have a wealth level of 0)?\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i} &= 2^{-3.17} \\times 2^{1.19(1)}\\\\\n&= 0.111 \\times 2.28 \\\\\n&= 0.253\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe predicted CO2 emission for a countries that have a wealth level of 1 is 0.253 metric tons per person. This is 2.28 TIMES the emissions of countries that have a wealth level of 0. How about countries that have a wealth level of 2 (a one-unit difference in wealth from countries that have a wealth level of 1)?\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i} &= 2^{-3.17} \\times 2^{1.19(2)}\\\\\n&= 0.111 \\times 5.21 \\\\\n&= 0.578\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nUsing another rule of exponents we could re-write this last fitted equation as:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{CO2}_i} &= 2^{-3.17} \\times (2^{1.19})^2\\\\\n&= 0.111 \\times 2.28^2 \\\\\n&= 0.111 \\times 2.28 \\times 2.28 \\\\\n&= 0.578\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThis is 2.28 TIMES the emissions of countries that have a wealth level of 1. Each 1-unit increase in wealth is associated with an increase in CO2 emissions of a factor of 2.28 (i.e., 2.28 times higher CO2 emissions). The technical language we use to express “2.28 times” is a “2.28-fold difference”. So we would conventionally interpret this as:\n\nEach one-unit difference in wealth level is associated with a 2.28-fold difference in carbon emissions, on average.\n\nTo summarize, when we back-transform from interpretations of log-Y to Y the rate-of-change is multiplicative rather than additive. And to determine the multiplicative rate-of-change, we take the base we chose to the power of the estimated slope, that is:\n\\[\n\\text{Rate-of-Change} = \\text{base}^{\\hat\\beta_1}\n\\]\nA computational shortcut to obtain the back-transformed interpretations is to exponentiate the output of the coef() function (which returns the coefficients from the fitted model).\n\n# Obtain back-transformed interpretations\n2 ^ coef(lm.log2)\n\n(Intercept)      wealth \n  0.1111884   2.2788237"

Since it is hard to work with these smaller values, in practice, we often compute and work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood. So in our example, \\(\\mathcal{L}_1 = 4.71647 \\times 10^{-50}\\) and the log-likelihood would be:\n\n# Log-likelihood for Model 1\nlog(4.71647e-50)\n\n[1] -113.5782\n\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the log-likelihood for Model 2 as:\n\n# Log-likelihood for Model 2\nlog(5.231164e-48)\n\n[1] -108.8695\n\n\nWe typically denote log-likelihood using a scripted lower-case “l” (\\(\\mathcal{l}\\)).

Less negative log-likelihood values correspond to higher likelihood values, which indicate more empirical support. Here Model 2 has a less negative log-likelihood value (\\(-108\\)) than Model 1 (\\(-113\\)), which indicates there is more empirical support for Model 2 than Model 1.\nWe can also express the likelihood ratio using log-likelihoods.

We can of course, re-express this using the the regression parameters:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{l}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1 | \\mathrm{data}) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\ln (2\\pi\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}} \\times \\sum \\big[Y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1(X_i)\\big]^2\n\\]\nAnd, again, since \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\) is a function of the regression coefficients and \\(n\\), this means that the only variables in the log-likelihood function are the coefficients."

We will learn more about this in the next set of notes, but for now, we will just use logLik() to compute the log-likelihood.\nHere we compute the log-likelihood for Model 2 using the logLik() function. We also use the output to compute the likelihood, and the likelihood ratio between Model 2 and Model 1\n\n# Compute log-likelihood for Model 2\nlogLik(lm.2)\n\n'log Lik.' -108.7964 (df=4)\n\n# Compute likelihood for Model 2\nexp(logLik(lm.2)[1])\n\n[1] 5.627352e-48\n\n# Compute LR\nexp( logLik(lm.2)[1] - logLik(lm.1)[1] )\n\n[1] 115.6734\n\n\nBecause the output from logLik() includes extraneous information (e.g., df), we use indexing (square brackets) to extract only the part of the output we want. In this case, the [1] extracts the log-likelihood value from the logLik() output (ignoring the df part).\nAlso of note is that the df for Model 2 is four, indicating that this model is estimating four parameters (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{SAT}}\\), \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{Sector}}\\), and \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)). The value of df in the logLik() output is a quantification of the model’s complexity. Here Model 2 (df = 4) is more complex than Model 1 (df = 3).\nAs we consider using the likelihood ratio (LR) or the difference in log-likelihoods for model selection, we also need to consider the model complexity. In our example, the likelihood ratio of 115.7 (computed using logLik()) indicates that Model 2 has approximately 116 times the empirical support than Model 1. But, Model 2 is more complex than Model 1, so we would expect that it would be more empirically supported.\nIn this case, with a LR of 116, it seems like the data certainly support adopting Model 2 over Model 1, despite the added complexity of Model 2. But what if the LR was 10? Would that be enough additional support to warrant adopting Model 2 over Model 1? What about a LR of 5?"

    "text": "Empirical Support is for the Working Hypotheses\nBecause the models are proxies for the scientific working hypotheses, the AIC ends up being a measure of empirical support for any particular working hypothesis. Using the AIC, we can rank order the models (and subsequently the working hypotheses) based on their level of empirical support. Ranked in order of empirical support, the four scientific working hypotheses are:\n\nH3: Institutional prestige is a function of the institution’s characteristics, student- and faculty-resources, and student- and faculty-outcomes.\nH2: Institutional prestige is a function of the institution’s characteristics, and student- and faculty-resources.\nH1: Institutional prestige is a function of the institution’s characteristics.\nH0: Institutional prestige is not a function of anything other than the individual institution.\n\nIt is important to remember that the phrase given the data and other candidate models is highly important. The ranking of models/working hypotheses is a relative ranking of the models’ level of empirical support contingent on the candidate models we included in the comparison and the data we used to compute the AIC.\nAs such, this method is not able to rank any hypotheses that you did not consider as part of the candidate set of scientific working hypotheses. Moreover, the AIC is a direct function of the likelihood which is based on the actual model fitted as a proxy for the scientific working hypothesis. If the predictors used in any of the models had been different, it would lead to different likelihood and AIC values, and potentially a different rank ordering of the hypotheses.\nThe ranking of models is also based on the data we have. If we had different ranges of the data or a different set of variables, the evidence might support a different model. This is very important.

    "text": "Logarithmic Function: Yet Another Non-Linear Function\nOne way to model this non-linearity is to fit a model that included a quadratic polynomial effect. Remember that the quadratic function is ‘U’-shaped. In our example, the quadratic term was negative, which creates an upside-down ‘U’-shape. This negative quadratic function is shown in the left-had side of the figure below.\nWe do not have to use a quadratic function to model curvilinear relationships. We can use any mathematical function that mimics the curvilinear pattern observed in the data.1 One mathematical function that is useful for modeling curvilinearity is the logarithmic function. The logarithmic function is shown in the right-hand side of the figure below.\n\n\nCode\nfig_01 = data.frame(\n  x = seq(from = -5, to = 3, by = 0.1)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(y =  -(x^2))\n\np1 = ggplot(data = fig_01, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    theme_light() +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"X\", breaks = NULL) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Y\", breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Quadratic Function\")\n\n\nfig_02 = data.frame(\n  x = seq(from = 0.1, to = 5, by = 0.1)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(y =  log2(x))\n\np2 = ggplot(data = fig_02, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    theme_light() +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"X\", breaks = NULL) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Y\", breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Logarithmic Function\")\n\n# Layout the plots\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: LEFT: Negative quadratic function of X. RIGHT: Logarithmic function of X.\n\n\n\n\nThese two functions have some similarities. They both model non-linear growth (continuous and diminishing growth). However, in the quadratic function, this growth eventually peaks and then is followed by continuous and increasing loss (parabola; the function changes direction). The logarithmic function, on the other hand, does not change direction—it continues to grow, albeit ever diminishing in the amount of growth.2\nAs you consider different mathematical functions, it is important to consider the substantive knowledge in an area. For example, while empirically both the quadratic polynomial model and the logarithmic model might both suggest reasonable fit to the data, in this context, the logarithmic model might be a more substantively sound model than the quadratic polynomial model. We would probably expect that the effect of SAT on graduation rate would diminish for schools with higher median SAT scores, but that it wouldn’t actually change direction. (This would mean that at some value, an increase in SAT would be associated with a lower graduation rate!)"

(Note that we do not transform the Y-value.) The choice of base for the logarithm is irrelevant statistically, but does impact the interpretation of the slope. To illustrate, we will examine fitting models using base-2, base-10, and base-e. Rather than mutating the log-transformed variables into the data, we will include the log-transformation directly in the lm() function."

    "text": "Using Base-2 Log-Transformed SAT Scores in the Regression Model\nTo fit the model, we use the lm() function and input the log-transformed SAT scores as the predictor.\n\n# Fit regression model\nlm.log2 = lm(grad ~ 1 + log(sat, base = 2), data = mn)\n\n\nWe can now look at the regression output and interpret the results.\n\n# Model-level output\nglance(lm.log2)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nExamining the model-level output, we see that differences in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) explain 81.13% of the variation in graduation rates. Since differences in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) imply that there are differences in the raw SAT scores, we would typically just say that “differences in SAT scores explain 81.13% of the variation in graduation rates.”\nMoving to the coefficient-level output,\n\n# Coefficient-level output\ntidy(lm.log2)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can write the fitted equation as,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}_i} = -306.7 + 106.4\\bigg[\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}_i)\\bigg]\n\\]\nWe can interpret the coefficients as we always do, recognizing that these interpretation are based on the log-transformed predictor.\n\nThe intercept value of \\(-306.7\\) is the predicted average graduation rate for all colleges/universities with a \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) value of 0.\nThe slope value of 106.4 indicates that each one-unit difference in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) is associated with a 106.4-unit difference in graduation rate, on average.\n\n\n\nBetter Interpretations: Back-transforming to the Raw Metric\nWhile these interpretations are technically correct, it is more helpful to your readers (and more conventional) to interpret any regression results in the raw metric of the variable rather than log-transformed metric. This means we have to back-transform the interpretations. To back-transform a logarithm, we use its inverse function; exponentiation.\nWe interpreted the intercept as, “the predicted average graduation rate for all colleges/universities with a \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) value of 0”. To interpret this using the raw metric of our SAT attribute, we have to understand what \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) = 0\\) is equivalent to in the original SAT variable’s scale. Mathematically,\n\\[\n\\log_2 (\\mathrm{SAT}) = 0 \\quad \\mathrm{is~equivalent~to} \\quad 2^{0} = \\mathrm{SAT} \\\\\n\\]\nIn this computation, \\(\\mathrm{SAT}=1\\). Thus, rather than using the log-transformed interpretation, we can, instead, interpret the intercept as,\n\nThe predicted average graduation rate for all colleges/universities with a median SAT value of 1 (which since this is measures in hundreds corresponds to a median SAT of 100) is \\(-306.7\\). Since there are no colleges/universities in our data that have a median SAT value of 1, this is extrapolation.\n\nWhat about the slope? Our interpretation was that “each one-unit difference in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) is associated with a 106.4-unit difference in graduation rate, on average.” Working with the same idea of back-transformation, we need to understand what a one-unit difference in \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) means. Consider four values of \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) that are each one-unit apart:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) &= 1\\\\\n\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) &= 2\\\\\n\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) &= 3\\\\\n\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT}) &= 4\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nIf we back-transform each of these, then we can see how the four values of the raw SAT variable would differ.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{SAT} &= 2^1 = 2\\\\\n\\mathrm{SAT} &= 2^2 = 4\\\\\n\\mathrm{SAT} &= 2^3 = 8\\\\\n\\mathrm{SAT} &= 2^4 = 16\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\log_2(\\mathrm{SAT})\\) is increased by one-unit, the raw SAT value is doubled. We can use this in our interpretation of slope:\n\nA doubling of the SAT value is associated with a 106.4 percentage point difference in graduation rate, on average.\n\nThe technical language for doubling is a “two-fold difference”. So we would conventionally interpret this as:\n\nEach two-fold difference in SAT value is associated with a 106.4 percentage point difference in graduation rate, on average.\n\nTo understand this further, consider a specific school, say Augsburg. Their measurement on the raw SAT variable is 10.3, and their log-transformed SAT score is 3.36. Using the fitted regression equation (which employs the log-transformed SAT),\n\n-306.7 + 106.4 * 3.36\n\n[1] 50.804\n\n\nAugsburg’s predicted graduation rate would be 50.8. If we increase the l2sat score by 1 to 4.36 (which is equivalent to a raw SAT measurement of 20.6; double 10.3), their predicted graduation rate would be,\n\n-306.7 + 106.4 * 4.36\n\n[1] 157.204\n\n\nThis is an increase of 106.4 percentage points from the predicted value of 50.8 when the l2sat value was 3.36."

    "text": "Using Base-e Log-Transformed SAT Scores in the Regression Model\nIn our example, neither of the bases we examined is satisfactory in terms of interpreting the effect of median SAT score on graduation rate. Two-fold differences in median SAT scores are very unlikely, to say anything of ten-fold differences. One base that is commonly used for log-transformations because it offers a reasonable interpretation is base-e. Below we regress graduation rates on the log-transformed SAT scores, using the natural logarithm.\n\n# Fit model\nlm.ln = lm(grad ~ 1 + log(sat), data = mn)\n\n# Model-level output\nglance(lm.ln)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Coefficient-level output\ntidy(lm.ln)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAs with any base, using base-e results in the same model-level evidence (\\(R^2=.811\\), AIC values).

(This is, again, because \\(2^0=10^0=e^0=1\\).) And, although the coefficient and SE for the effect of SAT is again different (a one-unit change in the three different log-scales does not correspond to the same amount of change in raw SAT for the three models).\nSo how can we interpret the model’s coefficients?\n\nThe intercept can be interpreted exactly the same as in the previous models in which we used base-2 or base-10; namely that the predicted average graduation rate for colleges/universities with a SAT value of one (median SAT score of 100) is \\(-306.7\\).\nInterpreting the slope, we could say that an e-fold difference in SAT value is associated with a 153.6-unit difference in graduation rates, on average.\n\nWe can aslo verify that this model’s residuals are identical to the other log-transformed models’ residuals.\n\n# Obtain residuals for base-2 log-transformed SAT\nresidual_plots(lm.ln)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values for a model fitted using the natural log-transformed median SAT scores.

Using the fitted equation, we can compute the predicted graduation rate for each of these hypothetical schools:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Graduation~Rate}} = -306.7 + 153.6 \\bigg[\\ln (\\mathrm{SAT})\\bigg]\n\\]\nThe SAT values and predicted graduation rates for these schools are given below:\n\n\nCode\n# Create data\ntab_05 = data.frame(\n  sat = c(10, 10.1, 10.201)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    grad = predict(lm.ln, newdata = .)\n  )\n\n# Create table\ntab_05 |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(sat, grad),\n    align = \"center\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    sat = md(\"*SAT*\"),\n    grad = md(\"Predicted Graduation Rate\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(40)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Median SAT Values and Graduation Rates for Three Hypothetical Schools\nthat have Median SAT Values that Differ by One Percent. \n  \n    \n    \n      SAT\n      Predicted Graduation Rate\n    \n  \n  \n    10.000\n46.87784\n    10.100\n48.40581\n    10.201\n49.93378\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between each subsequent predicted graduation rate is 1.53.\n\n# Difference between predicted value for 10.1 and 10\n48.4058 - 46.8778\n\n[1] 1.528\n\n# Difference between predicted value for 10.201 and 10.1\n49.9338 - 48.4058\n\n[1] 1.528\n\n\nIn other words, schools that have a SAT value that differ by 1%, have predicted graduation rates that differ by 1.53, on average.\n\nBe very careful when you are using “percent difference” and “percentage points difference”. These are two very different things. For example, increasing a graduation rate from 50% to 60% represents a difference of 10 percentage points, but it is a 20% increase!\n\n\n\n\nMathematically Calculating the Size of the Effect\nTo understand how we can directly compute the effect for a 1% change in X, consider the predicted values for two x-values that differ by 1%, if we use symbolic notation:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{y}_1 &= \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(x)\\right] \\\\\n\\hat{y}_2 &= \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(1.01x)\\right]\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe difference in their predicted values is:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{y}_2 - \\hat{y}_1 &= \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(1.01x)\\right] - \\left(\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(x)\\right]\\right) \\\\[1ex]\n&=\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(1.01x)\\right] - \\hat\\beta_0 - \\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(x)\\right] \\\\[1ex]\n&=\\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(1.01x)\\right] - \\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(x)\\right] \\\\[1ex]\n&=\\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(1.01x) - \\ln(x)\\right]\\\\[1ex]\n&=\\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(\\frac{1.01x}{1x})\\right]\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nIf we substitute in any value for \\(x\\), we can now directly compute this constant difference. Note that a convenient value for X is 1. Then this reduces to:\n\\[\n\\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(1.01)\\right]\n\\]\nSo now, we can interpret this as: a 1% difference in X is associated with a \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\left[\\ln(1.01)\\right]\\)-unit difference in Y, on average.\nIn our model, we can compute this difference using the fitted coefficient \\(\\hat\\beta_1=153.6\\) as\n\\[\n153.6\\left[\\ln(1.01)\\right] = 1.528371\n\\]\nThe same computation using R is\n\n153.6 * log(1.01)\n\n[1] 1.528371\n\n\nThis gives you the constant difference exactly. So you can interpret the effect of SAT as, each 1% difference in SAT score is associated with a difference in graduation rates of 1.53 percentage points, on average.\n\n\n\nApproximating the Size of the Effect\nWe can get an approximation for the size of the effect by using the mathematical shortcut of:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Effect} \\approx \\frac{\\hat\\beta_1}{100}\n\\]\nUsing our fitted results, we could approximate the size of the effect as,\n\\[\n\\frac{153.6}{100} = 1.536\n\\]\nWe could then interpret the effect of SAT by saying a 1% difference in median SAT score is associated with a 1.53 percentage point difference in predicted graduation rate, on average."
