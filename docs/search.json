For example, in our standard normal distribution outcomes near zero are more probable than outcomes near 1, which are more probable than outcomes near 2, etc. Since we can’t use probability to do this (remember the probability of each outcome is the same, namely 0), we use something called probability density. This is akin to a relative probability, so outcomes with a higher probability density are more likely than outcomes with a lower probability density.\nThe mapping of all the outcomes to their probability densities is called a probability density function (PDF). Thus the equation or “bell-shaped” curve describing the standard normal distribution in Figure 1 is technically a PDF Here are some laws governing PDFs:\n\nProbability densities are always positive.\nThe probability of an outcome x between a and b equals the integral (area under the curve) between a and b of the probability density function. That is:\n\n\\[\np(a \\leq x \\leq b) = \\int_a^b p(x) dx\n\\]\n\nThe area under the curve from negative infinity to positive infinity is 1.

    "section": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density",
    "text": "pnorm(): Computing Cumulative Probability Density\nThe function pnorm() computes the area under the PDF curve from \\(-\\infty\\) to some x-value. (Sometimes this is referred to as the cumulative probability density of x.) It is important to note that the PDF is defined such that the entire area under the curve is equal to 1. Because of this, we can also think about using area under the curve as an analog to probability in a continuous distribution.\nFor example, we might ask about the probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 given it is from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. Symbolically, we want to find:\n\\[\nP\\bigg(x \\leq 65 \\mid \\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\bigg)\n\\]\nThis is akin to finding the proportion of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) PDF that is to the left of 65. The figure below shows a graphical depiction of the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\nCode\n# Create dataset\nfig_03 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = 10, to = 90, by = 0.01)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n    )\n\n# Filter out X&lt;=65\nshaded = fig_03 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &lt;= 65)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_03, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shaded, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"X\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution. The area that is shaded grey (relative to the total area under the PDF) represents the cumulative probability density for \\(x=65\\).\n\n\n\n\nWe can compute the cumulative probability density using the pnorm() function. The “p” stand for “probability”.\n\n# Find P(x&lt;=65 | N(50,10) )\npnorm(q = 65, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 0.9331928\n\n\nWe can interpret this as:\n\nThe probability of observing an x-value that is less than or equal to 65 (if it is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10) is 0.933.\n\nIn mathematics, the area under a curve is called an integral. The grey-shaded area in the previous figure can also be expressed as an integral of the probability density function:\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{65} p(x) dx\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(x)\\) is the PDF for the normal distribution.\nThe most common application for finding the cumulative density is to compute a p-value. The p-value is just the area under the distribution (curve) that is AT LEAST as extreme as some observed value. For example, assume we computed a test statistic of \\(z=2.5\\), and were evaluating whether this was different from 0 (two-tailed test). Graphically, we want to determine the proportion of the area under the PDF that is shaded grey in the figure below.\n\n\nCode\n# Create data\nfig_04 = data.frame(\n  X = seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.01)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Y = dnorm(x = X, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n    )\n\n# Filter data for shading\nshade_01 = fig_04 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &gt;= 2.5)\n\nshade_02 = fig_04 %&gt;%\n  filter(X &lt;= -2.5)\n\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = fig_04, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_01, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_ribbon(data = shade_02, ymin = -10, aes(ymax = Y), color = \"#bbbbbb\", alpha = 0.4) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlab(\"z\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability density\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the probability density function (PDF) for the standard normal distribution (\\(M=0\\), \\(SD=1\\)). The cumulative density representing the p-value for a two-tailed test evaluating whether \\(\\mu=0\\) using an observed mean of 2.5 is also displayed.\n\n\n\n\nIf the distribution of the test statistic is normally distributed, we can use pnorm() to compute the p-value. If we assume the test statistic, z, has been scaled to use standardized units, the standard deviation we use in pnorm() will be sd=1. The mean is based on the value being tested in the null hypothesis. In most null hypotheses, we are testing a difference from 0 (e.g., \\(H_0: \\mu=0\\), \\(H_0: \\beta=0\\)), so we would use mean=0 in the pnorm() function.\nRemember, pnorm() computes the proportion of the area under the curve TO THE LEFT of a particular value. Here we will compute the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) and then double it to produce the actual p-value. (We can double it because the normal distribution is symmetric so the area to the left of \\(-2.5\\) is the same as the area to the right of \\(+2.5\\).)\n\n# Compute the p-value based on z=2.5\n2 * pnorm(q = -2.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.01241933\n\n\nWe interpret this p-value as:\n\nThe probability of observing a statistic at least as extreme as 2.5, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is 0.012. This is evidence against the null hypothesis since the data are inconsistent with the assumed hypothesis.\n\n\n\nqnorm(): Computing Quantiles\nThe qnorm() function is essentially the inverse of the pnorm() function. The pnorm() function computes the cumulative probability GIVEN a particular quantile (x-value). The qnorm() function computes the quantile GIVEN a cumulative probability. For example, in the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) distribution, half of the area under the PDF is below the x-value (quantile) of 50.\nTo use the qnorm() function to give the x-value (quantile) that defines the lower 0.5 of the area under the \\(\\mathcal{N}(50, 10)\\) PDF, the syntax would be:\n\n# Find the quantile that has a cumulative density of 0.5 in the N(50, 10) distribution\nqnorm(p = 0.5, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\n\n\nrnorm(): Generating Random Observations\nThe rnorm() function can be used to generate random observations drawn from a specified normal distribution. Aside from the mean= and sd= arguments, we also need to specify the number of observations to generate by including the argument n=. For example, to generate 15 observations drawn from a \\(\\mathcal{N}(50,10)\\) distribution we would use the following syntax:\n\n# Generate 15 observations from N(50,10)\nset.seed(100)\nrnorm(n = 15, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n\n [1] 44.97808 51.31531 49.21083 58.86785 51.16971 53.18630 44.18209 57.14533\n [9] 41.74741 46.40138 50.89886 50.96274 47.98366 57.39840 51.23380\n\n\nThe set.seed() function sets the state of the random number generator used in R so that the results are reproducible. If you don’t use set.seed() you will get a different set of observations each time you run rnorm(). Here we set the starting seed to 100, but you can set this to any integer you want."

    "section": "Mean Squares are Variance Estimates",
    "text": "Mean Squares are Variance Estimates\nMean squares are also estimates of the variance. Consider the computational formula for the sample variance,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum(Y - \\bar{Y})^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nThis is the total sum of squares divided by the total df. The variance of the outcome variable is interpreted as the average amount of variation in the outcome variable (in the squared metric). Thus, it is also referred to as the mean square total.\nWhen we compute an F-statistic, we are finding the ratio of two different variance estimates—one based on the model (explained variance) and one based on the error (unexplained variance). Under the null hypothesis that \\(\\rho^2 = 0\\), we are assuming that all the variance is unexplained. In that case, our F-statistic would be close to zero. When the model explains a significant amount of variation, the numerator gets larger relative to the denominator and the F-value is larger.\nThe mean squared error (from the anova() output) plays a special role in regression analysis. It is the variance estimate for the conditional distributions of the residuals in our visual depiction of the distributional assumptions of the residuals underlying linear regression.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Visual Depiction of the Distributional Assumptions of the Residuals Underlying Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\nRecall that we made implicit assumptions about the conditional distributions of the residuals, namely that they were identically and normally distributed with a mean of zero and some variance. Based on the estimate of the mean squared error, the variance of each of these distributions is 58.5.\nWhile the variance is a mathematical convenience, the standard deviation is often a better descriptor of the variation in a distribution since it is measured in the original metric. The standard deviation fro the residuals (error) is 7.6. Because the residuals are statistics (summaries computed from sample data), their standard deviation is referred to as a “standard error”.\n\nThe residual standard error (RSE) is sometimes referred to as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\n\n# Compute RMSE\nsqrt(58.5)\n\n[1] 7.648529\n\n\nWhy is this value important? It gives the expected variation in the conditional residual distributions, which is a measure of the average amount of error. For example, since all of the conditional distributions of the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed, we would expect that 95% of the residuals would fall between \\(\\pm2\\) standard errors from 0; or, in this case, between \\(-15.3\\) and \\(+15.3\\). Observations with residuals that are more extreme may be regression outliers.\nMore importantly, it is a value that we need to estimate in order to specify the model."

A label is the name of this code chunk. (Any code chunk, even if it is not a plot, can have a label.) In the plot below, the chunk’s label is fig-scatterplot.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that by labeling this chunk, the figure is numbered in the document. We also added a caption using the fig-cap: option.\n\n\nFigure Size\nThere are a couple other chunk options for figures that help set the aspect ratio and size of the figure in your document. The aspect ratio is the ratio of a figure’s width to its height. We set this using the fig-width: and fig-height: chunk options. (The default value for both is 6; thus the figure appears square.) Below we change these so that the figure appears wider than it is tall.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot-2\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\n#| fig-width: 9\n#| fig-height: 5\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to change the aspect ratio when you have legends or when you are using {patchwork} to stack or put multiple figures next to each other. Many times you need to find a good aspect ratio though trial-and-error of trying different values.\n\nThe actual size of the figure in the document is independent of the aspect ratio and can be set using the out-width: or out-height: chunk option. These options take a character string of the direct size (in HTML documents this is typically in pixels) or of the percentage of the output width/height. Here we keep the same aspect ratio, but make the figure smaller by setting the figure width to 40% of the document’s width.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-scatterplot-3\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\"\n#| fig-width: 9\n#| fig-height: 5\n#| out-width: \"40%\"\nggplot(data = fertility, aes(x = educ_female, y = infant_mortality)) +\n   geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set the aspect ratio of the figure, you need only set out-width: or out-height:. You don’t need to set both as the other will be determined by the aspect ratio."

For example “Female Education Level” is a better name than “educ_female”.\n\nThis means we will need to add spaces into our variable names in the mathematical expression. If you tried that earlier, you found out that just hitting the spacebar does not produce a space in the outputted expression. We need to include a tilde (~) every time you want a space. So to get the name “Female Education Level” we need to use the following in our equation:\n$$\nFemale~Education~Level\n$$\n\nVariable names should also be typeset using normal text rather than italic (the default in mathematical expressions).\n\nTo achieve this, we have to embed the text we want to be normal in the syntax \\mathrm{}. This typesets the text in a roman font (normal text). For example:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Female~Education~Level}\n$$\nYou can also use \\mathit{} (italics), \\mathbf{} (bold), \\mathtt{} (typewriter text), and \\mathcal{} (caligraphy; this is useful for the “N” we use to indicate a normal distribution).\n\nHyphens need special syntax since a hyphen would be interpreted as a minus sign. In typesetting, the minus sign is longer than the hyphen symbol.\n\nIf you want to include a hyphen, we need to include it in \\mbox{}. For example, to add a hyphen in our variable name to get “Female Education-Level”, we use:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Female~Education\\mbox{-}Level}\n$$\n\nUpdate your fitted equation from before to include spaces in variable names.

That being said, as you develop naming conventions for your projects, all the conventions should be documented! This documentation helps onboard collaborators to your project.\n\nThere are several guides available to help you establish naming conventions including here and here."

However, they do typically include Markdown syntax (which is itself plain text). The plain text nature of these files keeps them small in size and accessible to anyone with any type of computer.\n\nThere are several online guides for what to include in a README file, including here and here. There is also a pretty good template for a README for data science oriented projects here.\n\nSince the README file is informational, you can include any type of information in this file that is useful to the project. For example, you could add your naming conventions to this file.\n# assignment-01\n\nThis directory contains all of the files necessary to complete Assignment 1.\n\n\n# Naming Conventions\n\n- File names should be short but descriptive (less than 25 characters)\n- All lowercase letters\n- Avoid special characters and spaces in a file name\n  + Use hyphens instead of spaces to separate words (e.g., `assignment-01`)\n- Any names that include the date will use the ISO 8601 date format (YYYYMMDD)\n- Any names that include a number will include at least two digits (e.g., `assignment-01` rather than `assignment-1`)\n\nWhile you should only have one README file per directory, you can have different README files in other directories. For example, you could create a README file in the data directory that includes the codebook information for your data files."

The course content for EPsy 8252 builds on the content of EPsy 8251 and includes: (1) non-linear transformations, (2) likelihood estimation and inference, (2) information criteria for model selection, (3) logistic models for analyzing dichotomous outcomes, and (4) mixed-effects models for analysis of longitudinal data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPsy 8252 is a 3 credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see Expected Time per Course Credit Policy). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10–15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that—it all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course."

    "text": "Statistical Computing\nStatistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 8251. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS https://www.r-project.org. It should be noted that while some R syntax and programming is taught during class time, there is also a fair amount that you may need to learn on your own outside of class. There are several tutorials and resources linked from the course website to help you learn R.\nYou can install R and RStudio onto your local machine. (There are instructions for how to do this on the course website.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.\n\n\nA Note on Inclusion and Respect\nIn this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another’s individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class."

Because the data for this predictor come from a Likert scale (ordinal in nature), we need to examine whether we can treat it as a continuous predictor in the model, or whether we should treat it as categorical.\n\nBegin by computing the empirical proportion of people that support same-sex marriage for each of the attendance categories. Create a line plot that shows the relationship between proportion of support and attendance.\n\nBased on the plot you just created, the relationship between proportion of support and attendance seems linear. Because of this, we can treat the Likert data as continuous; using a line (or polynomial) to fit the relationship. The only caution being that when interpreting a slope, we say something like, “a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)-unit difference in \\(Y\\)”. For ordinal (Likert) data a one-unit difference in \\(X\\) really indicates a shift from one category to the next highest category.\n\nFit two logistic models to the data using religious service attendance. In the first model, only include the linear effect of attendance. In the second model, include both a linear and quadratic effect to predict variation in support for same-sex marriage. Which model should be adopted (linear or quadratic)? Justify your response by providing any statistical evidence you used in reaching your decision.

Before you submit the assignment check that:\n\nAll group members’ names are on the assignment.\nAll tables are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.\nNo R syntax is included unless the question specifically asked for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata).\nDo not submit the script file you used unless the directions specifically ask you to submit it.\n\nDo I need to turn in the script file?\nNo…unless the directions specifically ask you to submit the script file. The script file is for your reference. Future assignments will sometimes have questions that reference older assignments, so an organized and well-commented script file is a good idea. Moreover, the TA or myself may ask you to submit your syntax after you submit the assignment to help us interpret mistakes you made on the assignment so that we can provide more thorough feedback.\nWill you provide answer keys to the assignments?\nNo. You will get back several comments on your assignments that address what you did wrong. The educational research is pretty clear that feedback is more helpful to student learning than providing correct answers. If you have further questions or need additional clarification, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you go over the answers in class?\nNo. I will address broad concepts if several students/groups made the same mistake, but otherwise, since each student/group makes unique mistakes going over the assignments more broadly is not a good use of our limited class time. The feedback should be helpful in understanding any mistakes you made, but if it isn’t, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you look at our assignment prior to us submitting it?\nThe instructor or TA will not “pre-grade” your assignment. If there is a “Preparation” part of the assignment we can ensure that you did that part correctly, and we can also give you feedback about syntax, but we will not tell you if an answer is correct or not. We can also answer clarifying questions (e.g., ‘I know Question 8 is asking about […], but I’m not sure what this question is looking for. Is there another way to restate this question?’). If you completed the assignment without any trouble, then be confident in your work and simply submit the assignment! 😄 If you are unsure about something specific, then ask about that specific thing rather than a general ‘did I do this right’!\nWill we be able to re-do the assignment?\nGenerally no. Since you have the opportunity to work in groups on the assignments, you should be able offset any of the issues that come up that would necessitate a re-submission. The exception to this is that we may allow you to re-do Assignment 1. If we do this, we will send you an email requesting that you resubmit part, or all of Assignment 1. You will not receive much feedback on your assignment prior to your re-submission. This is because during the first assignment you are learning not only content, but also expectations around how to respond to the questions we ask."

    "text": "Policy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work\nStudents are responsible for planning their schedules to avoid excessive conflicts with course requirements and must notify the instructor of unavoidable scheduling conflicts as early as possible. For circumstances where absences are unavoidable, accommodations for makeup work will be made according to University Policy. If you miss class:\n\nEmail the instructor as soon as you know you will be missing class.\nStudents are expected to obtain notes from a classmate of class material missed.\nPlease note that I will not be recording class sessions at the request of individual students, nor will I be Zooming students in to the class. Although, if you can arrange it with a classmate, they can Zoom you in.\n\nIf you are zooming in a classmate, please let the instructor know.\n\nIf you will be gone the day an assignment is due, you will need to make arrangements with the instructor about when you will turn in the assignment.\n\nIf you do not communicate with the instructor and make arrangements for turning in work when you are absent, the assignment will receive a 0.\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other AI Policy\nArtificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, are emerging tools that we will all need to consider in the next few years. These tools may be used to help you write R syntax, but not for answering any of the other questions on the assignment. If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me or the TA. If you do use any AI to help write syntax for any of the assignment questions you need to do the following:\n\nCite this in the assignment; failure to do so is in violation of the academic integrity policy at UMN. Please include a paragraph at the end of any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results. More examples of citing AI language models are available at: https://libguides.umn.edu/chatgpt.\nInclude a statement about what you will do to offset the environmental impact of the energy use incurred by using the AI. Be specific in this statement. For example: I will bike to school for the next week (Jan. 01–Jan 07) rather than drive or bus.\n\nYou are also responsible for ensuring any syntax composed by AI is correct. I would not trust anything AI says. If it gives you a number, fact, or code, assume it is wrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another source. For this reason, using AI works best for topics you understand and can quality check. Here are a couple of other things to be aware of if you decide to use AI:\n\nThe environmental impact of AI should not be ignored. The building and usage of AI tools consumes a lot of energy (see here and here).\nThe development of AI has been associated with labor abuse and other dicey ethical issues (see here and here).\n\nIf you are caught using AI to answer questions on any of the exams or quizzes, you will be given a 0 on that exam/quiz and a Scholastic Dishonesty Report Form will be filled out and reported to the Office of Community Standards. Depending on the severity of the offense, the instructor also reserves the right to give you an “F” in the course.\n\n\n\nTechnology Policy\nThe course uses technology on a regular basis during both instruction and assessments (e.g., homework assignments, exams, etc.). Student difficulty with obtaining or operating the various software programs and technologies—including printer trouble—will not be acceptable as an excuse for late work. Due to the variation in computer types and systems, the instructor or TA may not be able to assist in trouble shooting all problems you may have.\n\n\n\n\nCEHD Policy on Recording Classes\nAll class sessions may be recorded by the instructor using the procedures in the CEHD Policy on Recording Classes, with or without prior notice. Students should assume that a class session is being recorded unless otherwise notified. No person (student or otherwise) may record a class without express written permission from the instructor or an authorized administrator implementing a disability accommodation. All permitted recordings are governed by this policy’s limits on distribution and redistribution of recordings."

    "text": "Any table is essentially a rectangular layout (rows and columns) of information. Below I show two common tables of statistical output taken from the Regression Review notes. I have also added guide-lines to show the rectangular display of information within each of these tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate how to create a table in the QMD document, we will attempt to recreate Table 1 from the Regression Review notes. We can use the fact that data frames are also rectangular displays of information to create a table in the QMD document. The data.frame() function is used to enter the cell information from each column. This is, of course, done in a code chunk.\n\n# Input cell information\ntab_01 = data.frame(\n  variable = c(\"Environmental policy strength\", \"Corruption\", \"Wealth\", \"Toxic waste severity\", \n               \"Democratic control\", \"Interparty competition\", \"Public environmentalism\"),\n  m = c(17.6, .32, 28.15, 3.53, .63, 39.03, 2.49),\n  sd = c(8.23, .22, 36.38, 1.14, .26, 11.40, .10),\n  min = c(4, 0, 12.78, 0, 0, 9.26, 2.31),\n  max = c(37, .98, 278.01, 5.76, 1, 56.58, 2.7)\n)\n\n# Show output\ntab_01\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nHere we entered the cell data in manually, however, most of the time these values will be generated from functions that produce data frames. For example, the output from tidy(), glance(), correlate(), and {dplyr} functionality is a data frame. This output can be used directly when we create our table."

    "text": "Adding a Title and Subtitle (Using Quarto)\nIf you are creating a table within a QMD document, we will use the code chunk options to add a table number, title, and subtitle. To create these use the following code chunks:\n\nThe label: field is used to label the table and give it a table number. The key here is that the lable name must start withtbl-. In the example below, the label name I gave the table is tbl-summary-measures.\nThe tbl-cap: field is used to provide a table caption, similar to how fig-cap: is used to give a figure caption.\nThe tbl-subcap: field is used to provide a table subcaption. Not all tables need a subcaption!\nThe tbl-cap-location: field can be use to change the table caption location from top to bottom, or even have it placed in the margin.\n\nHere we show the R code chunk and chunk options to produce the table numbering and caption. (I do not use a subcaption on this table.) The resulting table, along with its numbering (which is autopopulated by Quarto), and caption is shown below.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-summary-measures\n#| tbl-cap: \"Summary statistics for the unstandardized outcome, focal predictor, and five covariates.\"\ntab_01 |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    variable = md(\"*Variable*\"),\n    m = md(\"*M*\"),\n    sd = md(\"*SD*\"),\n    min = md(\"*Min.*\"),\n    max = md(\"*Max.*\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(variable),\n    align = \"left\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(m, sd, min, max),\n    align = \"center\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_align_table_header(\"left\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.  Summary statistics for the unstandardized outcome, focal predictor,\nand five covariates. \n  \n    \n    \n      Variable\n      M\n      SD\n      Min.\n      Max.\n    \n  \n  \n    Environmental policy strength\n17.60\n8.23\n4.00\n37.00\n    Corruption\n0.32\n0.22\n0.00\n0.98\n    Wealth\n28.15\n36.38\n12.78\n278.01\n    Toxic waste severity\n3.53\n1.14\n0.00\n5.76\n    Democratic control\n0.63\n0.26\n0.00\n1.00\n    Interparty competition\n39.03\n11.40\n9.26\n56.58\n    Public environmentalism\n2.49\n0.10\n2.31\n2.70\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage to including a label: and naming it with a tbl- prefix is that it makes your tables cross-referenceable in the document. In the document’s text you can link to that table using the @ and giving the table name. For example, see Table 1. To do this I wrote the following in my Quarto document:\nFor example, see @tbl-summary-measures.\nSee here for more detail about cross-referencing tables, substables, figures, equations, and more!\n\nChanging the Formatting of the Table Numbering\nWe can change how Quarto formats the table labeling in the YAML part of the document. The default is: “Table X: Table Caption”. Here we make “Table X.” bold with a period after it, where “X” is an arabic number.\ncrossref:\n  tbl-title: \"**Table**\"\n  tbl-labels: arabic\n  title-delim: \".\""

    "text": "Fine-Tuning the Table\nThe table is very close to matching the original Table 1. But, there are still a couple of things (if you are an Enneagram One) that we need to attend to. For example, we could remove the horizontal lines in the table. These lines are called “borders” and we can modify them in the tab_style() function. This is a general function that allows us to customize many parts of the table (akin to theme() in ggplot()).\nTo do this we use the style= argument and call the cell_borders() function within tab_style(). Here we remove all borders (top, bottom, left, and right) by using sides=\"all\" and setting style=NULL. The tab_style() function also requires the argument locations=. We give this argument the function cell_body() which we provide the column and row numbers that we want to remove the borders from. Since we want to keep the horizontal border associated with the first and last rows, we omit those row numbers from the rows= argument.\n\n# Add title and subtitle\ntab_01 |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    variable = md(\"*Variable*\"),\n    m = md(\"*M*\"),\n    sd = md(\"*SD*\"),\n    min = md(\"*Min.*\"),\n    max = md(\"*Max.*\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(variable),\n    align = \"left\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    columns = c(m, sd, min, max),\n    align = \"center\"\n  ) |&gt;\n    tab_header(\n    title = md(\"**Table 1.** Summary statistics for the unstandardized outcome, focal predictor, and five covariates.\"),\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_align_table_header(\"left\")  |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_borders(\n      sides = \"all\", \n      style = NULL\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = 1:5,\n      rows = 2:6\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Table 1.
